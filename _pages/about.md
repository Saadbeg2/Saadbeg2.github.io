I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/), Austria, working under the supervision of Prof. Gernot Muller-Putz in the Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering (CSBME). My research focuses on developing interpretable deep learning frameworks for EEG data analysis, with applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **signal processing**, **deep learning**, and **neuroscience**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Interpretable Deep Learning for EEG**: Developing transparent neural network architectures that provide insights into how models process brain signals
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces**: Creating systems that decode neural signals for real-time human-machine interaction
- **Cross-Subject EEG Classification**: Building robust models that generalize across different individuals
- **Asynchronous BCI Systems**: Developing classifiers for real-time cognitive state detection

## Current Work

At Graz University of Technology, I am developing novel deep learning approaches for:

- **Interpretable ERP Detection**: A framework achieving 96.8% subject-independent accuracy while reducing model parameters by >50x compared to conventional CNNs
- **Large-scale Biosignal Processing**: Building denoising pipelines using Vision Transformers (ViT) and U-Net architectures for datasets with 500k+ samples
- **Error Processing Analysis**: Characterizing neural dynamics during balance perturbation using time-frequency and source domain analyses

## Collaborations

I am part of the [Austrian Marshall Plan Scholarship](https://www.marshallplan.at/) research exchange program, collaborating with the **University of San Diego (UCSD)** on large-scale EEG data processing using Vienna Cluster Service (VCS) GPUs.

I also collaborate with **Daimler Truck AG & FKFS** on decoding distraction events using brain signals combined with IMU and truck simulator data.

## Teaching

I serve as a Lecturer at Graz University of Technology, teaching courses on:
- Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces
- Fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering
- EEG Laboratory

In 2025, I received a Teaching Grant for a Joint Online Course with the University of Lisbon.
