I'm a third year postgraduate student from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. I'm currently pursuing the Master’s degree at the School of Mechnics and Engineering Science.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yujie Tang](https://tyj518.github.io/) of OPTIMA Lab from [School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics](https://amr.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
