## About

I’m Saad Salman Beg, a Computer Science student at the University of Houston with a focus on building practical technical skills in **cloud infrastructure, systems, and security-aware engineering**. I care most about work that feels real: projects where architecture, reliability, and clean execution matter.

I was born in **Fort Worth, Texas**, and spent most of my life growing up and studying in **Pakistan** before returning to the United States for university. That experience shaped how I approach problems — I’m comfortable adapting quickly, working across different environments, and communicating clearly with people from different backgrounds. I am a **U.S. citizen**, fully authorized to work in the United States.

During my AWS internship, I worked through structured training and internal lab environments to build strong fundamentals across core AWS services and architecture patterns. Outside of internships, I focus on building projects that demonstrate end-to-end thinking — from planning and system design to implementation and iteration.

Beyond tech, I’ve spent years in leadership roles. I currently lead the **Pakistan Student Association** at UH (500+ members), and I previously served as a **varsity rowing captain**, leading a team of 60 athletes to win a national rowing championship. Those experiences taught me how to execute under pressure, lead teams with accountability, and stay consistent over long timelines — skills that translate directly into engineering.

If you’d like to see what I’m working on, the best place to start is my **[Projects](/projects/)** page. For a more structured view of my background, visit **[Experience](/experience/)** or download my **[resume](/files/Saad_Salman_Beg_Resume.pdf)**.
