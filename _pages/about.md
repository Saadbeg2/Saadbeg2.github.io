I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/), working with Prof. Gernot Muller-Putz. My research focuses on developing **interpretable deep learning methods** for EEG signal analysis and **Brain-Computer Interfaces**.

## Research Interests

- Interpretable Deep Learning for EEG
- Brain-Computer Interfaces
- Neural Signal Processing
- Cross-subject Classification

## News

- **2025**: Teaching Grant for joint online course with University of Lisbon
- **2024**: Marshall Plan Scholarship for research collaboration with UCSD
- **2024**: Paper published in *Engineering Applications of AI* (IF: 8)
