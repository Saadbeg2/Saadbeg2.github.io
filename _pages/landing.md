## Saad Salman Beg

**Computer Science Student · Cloud & Systems Engineering Focus**

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Houston with a strong interest in **cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and security-aware system design**. I focus on building hands-on technical projects that reflect real-world engineering problems rather than academic exercises.

I am currently an **AWS Cloud Support Associate Intern**, where I completed structured technical training across core AWS services and earned multiple cloud certifications while working through internal labs and architecture-focused assignments.

Born in **Fort Worth, Texas** and raised in **Pakistan**, I bring a global perspective while being a **U.S. citizen**, fully authorized to work in the United States.

This site serves as a professional portfolio to document my work, experience, and technical growth.
