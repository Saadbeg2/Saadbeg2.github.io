## Overview

**FitPlan Pro** is a web-based fitness planning platform focused on **structured workout programming, progress tracking, and long-term habit consistency**. The project is designed as a systems-driven application rather than a static workout generator, emphasizing data organization, user state, and extensibility.

The goal of FitPlan Pro is to model how a real fitness product would manage plans, users, and progress over time — not just display exercises.

> **Status:** In active development

## Problem Statement

Most fitness apps either:
- Provide generic, one-size-fits-all routines, or
- Lock meaningful customization behind paid tiers

Additionally, many apps fail to:
- Track progress in a structured way
- Adapt plans as users improve
- Give users clarity on *why* a plan exists

FitPlan Pro aims to solve this by treating workout plans as **structured programs** rather than static lists of exercises.

---

## Core Concepts

FitPlan Pro is built around a few key ideas:

### 1. Program-Based Training
Workouts are part of a broader **program structure**, allowing:
- Progressive overload
- Goal-based planning
- Clear weekly and monthly intent

### 2. User State & Progress
The system tracks:
- Completed workouts
- Exercise history
- Progress over time

This allows future logic such as plan adjustments and performance insights.

### 3. Separation of Concerns
- Workout logic
- User profiles
- Progress data  
are treated as separate but connected components to support scalability.

---

## Current Features

- Goal-based workout planning
- User profile structure
- Progress tracking foundation
- Responsive front-end layout
- Modular exercise organization

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript**
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Component-based layout structure

### Design Focus
- Clean, distraction-free UI
- Emphasis on usability over visual effects
- Clear information hierarchy

---

## Design Decisions

- **No backend (yet):** Focused on frontend logic and data modeling first  
- **Modular structure:** Designed so backend integration can be added later without refactoring the UI  
- **Fitness-first logic:** Data structures reflect how real training programs are built  

---

## Planned Enhancements

- Backend API for persistent user data
- Authentication and user accounts
- Program progression logic
- Analytics and performance insights
- Exportable workout summaries

---

## Why This Project Matters

FitPlan Pro demonstrates:
- Product thinking beyond UI
- Data modeling for real-world use cases
- Incremental system design
- Planning for scalability before implementation

This project is intentionally evolving — its value is in *how* it grows, not just its current feature set.

## Live Status

🔗 **FitPlan Pro is currently in development**

For now, this project serves as a design and systems exercise.  
A live demo or repository will be linked once the core architecture stabilizes.
