This paper presents a novel hybrid Brain-Computer Interface speller that combines Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigms. The system achieves 93.06% classification accuracy and 23.41 bit/min information transfer rate, substantially improving performance over prior speller designs.
