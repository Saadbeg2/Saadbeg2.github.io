This study proposes an ensemble deep learning approach for automatic sleep stage classification using single-channel EEG and EOG signals.

The proposed model ensembles two EEGNet-BiLSTM models which learn EEG and EOG signals respectively. The study used EEG and EOG signals from 153 healthy subjects to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
