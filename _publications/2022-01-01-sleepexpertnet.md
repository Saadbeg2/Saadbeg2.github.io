This paper proposes SleepExpertNet, a high-performance and class-balanced deep learning approach for automatic sleep stage classification. The model is inspired by the decision-making processes of expert neurologists.

The proposed SleepExpertNet model addresses the challenges of manual sleep stage scoring, which is time-intensive and subjective. It is designed to reduce the workload on clinicians and support diagnostic decision-making, enabling more accurate sleep stage classification.
