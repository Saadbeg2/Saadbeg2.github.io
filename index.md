I am a postdoctoral fellow at **Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University**, working under the mentorship of **Prof. Junbo Ge** and **Prof. Li Shen**. My research is deeply rooted in the multidisciplinary intersection of interventional cardiology, material science, and artificial intelligence.

### Research Interests
Currently, my work focuses on developing next-generation cardiovascular technologies, including:

* **Intelligent Panvascular Intervention**: Leveraging AI-driven design for vascular devices and digital twin systems.
* **Advanced Materials**: Researching bioresorbable scaffolds and AI-designed hydrogel vascular liners.
* **Single-Cell Analysis**: Utilizing single-cell sequencing to create atlases for conditions like in-stent restenosis.

I am also actively involved in clinical translation, including projects related to the **XINSORB** bioresorbable stent and cryoablation techniques.
